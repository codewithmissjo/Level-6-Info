2. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) :
○ XSS is an injection attack targeting users in order to access accounts, activate a malware software or modify page content.
The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web application that executes the malicious code. Then, the web page or web application becomes a vehicle to deliver the malicious script to the user’s browser.

3. Remote File Inclusion:
○ A hacker uses this type of attack to remotely inject a file onto a web application server. This can result in the execution of malicious scripts or code within the application, as well as data theft or manipulation.

4. Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF):
An attack that could result in an unsolicited transfer of funds, changed passwords or data theft. It’s caused when a malicious web application makes a user’s browser perform an unwanted action in a site to which a user is logged on.

How to enable CSRF protection in the Flask app? CSRF protection could be enabled with the Flask-WTF extension.
